# ECE590 final Project - Revisiting the ADAM optimizer

#### A. Introduction of python and data set files

a. resnet20.py and pruned_layers.py: the implementation of ResNet-20 (source: ECE590 Homework 3).

b. train_util: training an architecture on the CIFAR10 data set using either SGD, Adam, or AdamW (with or without AMSGrad) algorithm.

c. adam.py: my implementation of Adam and AdamW algorithm (with or without AMSGrad).
(code reference: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/optim/sgd.py).

d. adam_exp.ipynb, adamW_exp.ipynb and SGD_exp.ipynb: Python notebook for the experiments for evaluating the performance of the algorithms on the CIFAR10 data set. If you woud like to run them on a computing cluster with GPUs, adam_exp.py, adamW_exp.py and SGD_exp.py are the python scripts for running the Slurm job arrays, and Adam.sh, AdamW.sh and SGD.sh are the bash scripts for Slurm.

e. makePlots.ipynb: notebook for reproducing figures in the report/poster using the saved summary statistics (e.g. training loss) in the directory of summary_stats

f. In the directory of data, there is the CIFAR10 data set (Since the data file is too large, it was not successfully uploaded.)




#### B. Introduction of saved files 

a. (directory) check_points: check points of the trained ResNet-20 models on the CIFAR10 data set. The names are in the format of "net_{method}_{weight decay parameter * 1e7}_amsgrad_{amsgrad status}_epoch_{total number of epochs}.pt". In particular, total number of epochs = 1800 and method = SGD, Adam or AdamW.

b. (directory) summary_stats: summary statistics from the entire run, with the names being in the format of  "net_{method}_{weight decay parameter * 1e7}_amsgrad_{amsgrad status}_epoch_{total number of epochs}.p". In particular, total number of epochs = 1800 and method = SGD, Adam or AdamW. There are two variables saved in each file, with the first variable being accuracies and the second one being losses. Both variables are a numpy array with dimensions (number of epochs * 2), with the first column associated with the training set and second column associated with the test set. For example, accuracy[5,0] refers to the training accuracy at Epoch 5; loss[100, 1] refers to the test loss at Epoch 100.

####  Note that to reproduce the figures, simply run makePlots.ipynb.
